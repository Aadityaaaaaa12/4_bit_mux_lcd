# 4_bit_mux_lcd
The 4-bit ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit) project provided an in-depth exploration into digital design using Verilog HDL, focusing on implementing fundamental arithmetic and logical operations in hardware. 
The objective was to design an ALU capable of performing tasks such as addition, subtraction, bitwise operations, and division/modulus, and to visualize the results on an LCD display module. Through this exercise, I gained hands-on experience in modular design, hierarchical coding practices, timing control for peripheral communication, and testbench-based simulation. Additionally, integrating the ALU with the LCD controller deepened my understanding of interfacing hardware modules and managing control signals in a synchronous system.

it is designed for the TERASIC DE2 DEV BOARD WITH THE CYCLONE II FPGA (EP2C35F672C6)
